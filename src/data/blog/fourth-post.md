excerpt: "Cutting back on your digital life to focus on what truly matters."

In a world designed for maximum screen time, embracing digital minimalism can feel like a radical act. It's not about abandoning technology entirely, but about being intentional with its use. The goal is to declutter your digital life to create more space for things that bring you joy and a deeper sense of connection in the real world.

Think of it as tidying up your online presence. Unfollow accounts that don't add value, unsubscribe from endless email lists, and turn off unnecessary notifications. The simple act of creating friction between you and your phone can have a profound impact on your mental well-being.

By being more deliberate about where you spend your digital energy, you can reclaim your time, reduce anxiety, and find a renewed sense of focus in an increasingly distracted world.
