Do you ever feel like you're working all day but not getting anything done? Time blocking might be the answer. It's a productivity method where you divide your day into specific blocks of time, assigning each block to a particular task or activity. This turns your to-do list into a schedule, making it a powerful tool against procrastination.

The key is to treat these time blocks like an appointment. A meeting with your work, a meeting with your creative project, and even a meeting with yourself for a break. This approach forces you to be realistic about what you can accomplish in a day and helps you avoid multitasking, which often leads to poor-quality work.

Start small. Block out 30-minute sessions for your most important tasks. You'll be amazed at how much you can get done when you give a single task your full, undivided attention.
